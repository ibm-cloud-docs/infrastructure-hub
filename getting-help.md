## Route your support case
{: #support-case-routing}

To correctly route your support case to speed up resolution, make sure that you select the right product when you open the case.

If you have issues when you are deploying an architecture, use the name of the deployable architecture as it is listed in the catalog. However, if you successfully deployed an architecture and have an issue with a service in the architecture, set that service as the product name in the support case.
