# Microsoft Hyper-V VM to {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} migration with RMM
{: #migrating-images-vmware-vsi}
{: toc-content-type="tutorial"}
{: toc-services="vpc, virtual-servers"}
{: toc-completion-time="60m"}

The RackWare Management Module (RMM) solution simplifies the overall migration process of moving the operating system, applications, and data from Microsoft Hyper-V VM to {{site.data.keyword.vsi_is_full}}. The migration can occur either over the public or private interface of the compute resource. The only requirement is that RMM is able to access both the source and target server over SSH.
{: shortdesc}

Follow the steps to complete a migration from your Microsoft Hyper-V VM on-premises or in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} classic to {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}.

## Supported operating systems
{: #supported-operating-systems-vmware-virtual}

- RHEL 8.x, 9.x
- CentOS Stream 9
- Debian 11, 12
- Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, 24.04
- Rocky Linux 8, 9
- Fedora CoreOS 40
- SUSE Linux Enterprise server 12, 15,
- Windows 2016, 2019, 2022

## Before you begin
{: #before-begin-vmware-virtual}

- Check for correct permissions for {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}.
- For each volume on the source server, 20 percent of the unused space must be available to store the snapshot that is created by RMM.
- Copy the RMM SSH public key to both the source and target servers.
    - This procedure can require modifying the servers' host route table or security rules.
    - Update the name server or DNS.
- The order of the target server, the CPU, and memory does not need to match, but the volumes must be equal to or greater than the source.
- Make sure that you have a `/etc/fstab` entry for automatic mounting of any file system on the target server.

To improve the data transfer rate, adjust the bandwidth allocation of the RMM server. For more information, see [Adjusting bandwidth allocation by using the UI](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-virtual-server-instances&interface=ui#adjusting-bandwidth-allocation-ui).
{: note}

## Order RMM
{: #order-rackware-rmm-catalog-vmware}
{: step}

You can order RMM-BYOL from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog. A virtual server with the RMM software is installed into the VPC that you provide when you order. The RMM server has a public IP address for reachability.

If public IP address is not attached to RMM server, then its 'Reserved IP' address can be used to access RMM server with [bastion host](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-vpc-secure-management-bastion-server).
{: note}

1. Order RMM-BYOL from the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog](/catalog/content/IBM-MarketPlace-P2P-1.3-22935832-bd76-49ab-b53e-12fc5d04c266-global){: external}.
2. After you order, log in to the RMM server.
3. In the RMM server, change the default password, create users, and create an SSH key.

## Order a license
{: #license-rackware-bring-vmware-vpc}
{: step}

The license that you need to migrate to {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} is Bring Your Own License (BYOL). The license is a subscription-based license, paid monthly, that you use to migrate one or more servers during the subscription period. You need to purchase the license directly from RackWare.

Complete the following steps to get a license:

1. Generate a license file in `/etc/rackware` by running the following command:

    ```sh
    rwadm relicense
    ```
    {: pre}

2. You need to purchase the license from RackWare by mailing the generated license file to [licensing@rackwareinc.com](mailto:licensing@rackwareinc.com) or [sales@rackwareinc.com](mailto:sales@rackwareinc.com).

3. After generation, a preinstall file that uses this command, send a license generation request to the RackWare licensing team with the following information:
    - RMM License (subject line)
    - Company name
    - License count
    - Preinstall file (attached)
    - Purchase order (attached)

4. Install the license.
    a. After you receive a valid license, download the license file and place it in `/etc/rackware`. Restart the services and apply the license by running the following command:

    ```sh
    rwadm restart
    ```
    {: pre}

    b. Verify the license by running the following command:

    ```sh
    rw rmm show
    ```
    {: pre}

##  Set up and provision VPC and virtual server instance
{: #cloud-vpc-vsi-rackware-setup}
{: step}

The RMM solution handles the OS, application, and data movement. It does not set up a target VPC. You must set up the VPC infrastructure and your virtual servers. At a bare minimum, you need to set up a VPC, subnets, and the corresponding virtual servers that you are planning to migrate. The new target instance profile (vCPU and vMemory) does not need to match the source.  However, as for the storage, it needs to be the same or greater in size.

1. Create a VPC.

2. Create subnets.

3. Order the virtual server instance:

    a. SSH key (RMM SSH keys need to be added in addition to the bastion SSH key)

    b. OS name (same major version as the source)

    c. Security groups

    d. Secondary volume

Make sure that your VPC, subnet, and other necessary cloud components are set up before you add the cloud user in RMM.
{: note}

## Prepare source and target servers
{: #source-target-compute-prep-vmware-vsi}
{: step}

Before you can begin, you need to do a few things on the source and target server for the migration:

1. The RMM server needs to connect with servers through SSH; thus the RMM public SSH keys need to be copied on both the source and target servers.

2. If the source server has both public and private interfaces, host routes need to be added to ensure the communication between the source and target servers. The routing is done over the transit gateway path or Direct Link 2.0 connection to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. Complete the following steps to prepare your relevant servers:

### Linux systems
{: #linux-systems-vmware-virtual}

1. Copy RMM SSH public key to both the source and target servers.

### Windows systems
{: #windows-systems-vmware-virtual}

1. Copy the RackWare RMM SSH public key to both the source and target servers.
2. You need to download the SSH key utility from the RMM server: `<https://<RMM_IP>/windows/RWSSHDService_x64.msi>`.
3. You are `SYSTEM`, and you need to enter the RMM SSH key to authenticate for both the source and target servers.

## Set up RMM waves
{: #rackware-rmm-v2v-vpc-migration}
{: step}

You can migrate the servers one-by-one or run multiple, simultaneous migrations. If you are running multiple, simultaneous migrations, then download the CSV template from the RMM server and complete the appropriate fields.

1. Log in to the RMM server.
2. Create a _Wave_ and define the _Wave_ name.
3. If you have multiple hosts, download the template, complete the appropriate fields, and then upload the template.
4. Select the _Wave_ name to enter source and target information.
5. Select the "+" sign.
6. Add source IP address or FQDN and add source username.
7. Target Type = Existing system
8. Sync Type = Direct sync
9. Add a target IP address or FQDN.
10. Add a target-friendly name, and add a target username.
11. Start the migration.

The username field for the Linux environment is `root`. The username field for the Windows environment is `SYSTEM`.
{: note}

Alternatively, you can use the discovery tool script, which helps with the discovery of virtual machines on the "System Center Virtual Machine Manager" (SCVMM) or Hyper-V host. The script also creates corresponding waves on the RMM server. The script asks for your SCVMM host username, the IP address of the SCVMM host to connect to, and the API where you discover your on-premises Hyper-V cluster virtual machines.

```sh
./discoveryTool -s SCVMM -u USERNAME -c CLUSTERNAME -d DOMAIN
```
{: pre}

Example:

```sh
./discoveryTool -s 10.10.10.1 -u administrator -c vCLUSTER -d DISCOVERY.LOCAL
```
{: screen}

Supported operating systems for Hyper-V discovery tool are Windows (2012, 2012
R2, 2016 and 2019) and RHEL 7.x and 8.x.
{: note}

For more information about the discovery tool, see this [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/vpc-migration-tools/blob/main/v2v-discovery-tool-rmm/HyperV/README.md){: external}.

## Run the migration
{: #rackware-rmm-perform-migration}
{: step}

1. When the source and target host are added in the wave and replication record, click the **Sync Options** tab. Then, select the **No Transfer** option, and click **Modify**. Then, click the play icon ![Play icon](../icons/play.svg) to start the replication. This action starts a dry run by checking the connection between the RMM and source or target servers. The dry run does not migrate data. If the operation is successful, then remove the No Transfer option that uses the same process.
2. Whenever you are ready, go ahead and click start replication (play icon![Play icon](../icons/play.svg)). This action starts the actual migration. If you expand the replication record, it displays the actual steps that are run, summarized with the necessary information.
3. Whether the operation is successful or not, you can see the job history in the replication record.
4. If the operation fails, you can retrieve the log and review detailed information.

## Validate your migration
{: #rackware-rmm-v2v-rackware-validation}
{: step}

Before you decommission the source server, it is imperative to validate the target server. The following list is not exhaustive, but suggests some of the items to validate:

- Access the target server
- Check partitions and volumes
- Check applications
- Install any test application in the target server
- Check networking routes
- Application or operating system licenses
- Remove RMM SSH keys
